# Sales_Analysis
Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data from a clothing store, which sells products through various e-commerce platforms such as Ajio, Myntra, Flipkart, Amazon, Meesho, Nykaa, Shopsy, and Snapdeal. The dataset was analyzed and processed using Microsoft Excel, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, order trends, product categories, and sales performance.

Features
- Age Group Categorization: Customers' ages are grouped into specific age ranges (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.) to analyze purchasing patterns based on age.
- Month Extraction: The month of each transaction is extracted from the Date column, which helps analyze seasonal trends.
- Order Status Analysis: The project includes detailed analysis of order statuses, allowing the user to examine canceled, returned, and refunded orders, in addition to successful deliveries.
- Sales Performance by Platform: Insights into how each e-commerce channel (Ajio, Myntra, Flipkart, Amazon, etc.) performs in terms of sales volume, revenue, and customer behavior.
- Product Category Breakdown: Detailed analysis of various product categories (e.g., ethnic dresses, tops, sarees) to understand which items are the most popular or profitable.
- Size and Quantity Analysis: Insights into which sizes are selling the most and how product quantity correlates with sales performance.

Excel Techniques Used
- Pivot Tables: Used for summarizing large datasets, such as calculating total sales per month or sales by e-commerce channel.
- Data Filtering: Enabled filtering of orders based on different parameters such as status, channel, or customer demographics.
- Formulas: Applied various Excel formulas to calculate total sales, categorize age groups, extract months from dates, and more.
- Charts: Created visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) to present trends in sales, age groups, and order statuses.
